| Average the 10s digits                       | $(3 + 7) / 2 = 5$  |                   |
| Add average to the product of the 10s digits | $5 + (3 * 7) = 26$ | Write down the 26 |
| Add 25 to the end                            |                    | Write down 25     |

If the average was not a whole number, round down and write 75 at the end instead of 25

### $65 \times 75$

| Step                                         | Math                             | Write down        |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Average the 10s digits                       | $(6 + 7) / 2 = 6.5$ (round to 6) |                   |
| Add average to the product of the 10s digits | $6 + (6 * 7) = 48$               | Write down the 48 |
| Average wasnt whole number so write down 75  |                                  | Write down 75     |
