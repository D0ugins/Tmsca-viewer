To find the product numbers that are the same distance above and below a certain value (ex. $48 \times 52$ both 2 away from 50) Find the number they are the distance away from (ex. 50) square it, then subtract the square of how far they are from the number (ex. $2^2$)

### $62 \times 68$

| Step                               | Math                | Write down |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| Both are 3 away from 65            |                     |            |
| [Find 65 squared](sqaureEndIn5.md) | $65^2 = 4275$       |            |
| Subtract 3 squared                 | $4275 - 3^2 = 4266$ | 4266       |

### Answer = 4266
