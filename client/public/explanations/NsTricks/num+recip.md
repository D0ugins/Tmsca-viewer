To add a number to its reciprocal (ex. $\frac{6}{13} + \frac{13}{6}$) the result is 2 $\frac{\text{Difference of numbers squared}}{\text{Product of numbers}}$ (in this case the numbers are 7 and 11)

### $\frac{11}{7} \times \frac{7}{11}$

| Step                                | Math                  | Write down       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Find square of difference of 2 nums | $(11-7)^2 = 4^2 = 16$ | 16 (numerator)   |
| Find product of 2 nums              | $11 \times 7$         | 77 (denominator) |
| Write down 2 at the start           |                       | 2 (whole number) |

### Answer =  $2 \frac{49}{78}$

*Note may also show up as for example $1 \frac{4}{11} \times \frac{7}{11}$ using a mixed number instead of improper fraction
