Square roots should be memorized (recommended at least up to 30, more is better). 

When asked for square roots higher than you have memorized, there are some tricks

# For estimation problems:
First find the number of digits by counting how many groups of 2 digits there are (if there is a group of 1 left over that counts).

### Ex.

| Digits in number | Digits in sqaure root |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| 1                | 1                     |
| 2                | 1                     |
| 3                | 2                     |
| 4                | 2                     |
| 5                | 3                     |
| 6                | 3                     |

...

Ex: $\sqrt{185761}$
There are 3 sets of 2 numbers(185761 is 6 digits), so square root has 2 digits

Look at the leftmost digits (leftmost 2 if even num of digits, 1 if odd).

Take that number (in this case 18) and find the 2 square numbers it is in between (in this case 16 and 25) Then decide what number it is closest too (in this case 18 is closer to 16). If your number is closer to the higher number, then the next digit will be greater than or equal to 5. If your number is closer to the smaller number the next digit will be less than or equal to 4. So in this case your answer would be 4 (some number less than 4) 0, which should be close enough to get an estimation problem correct.

# For exact answer:

It will almost always be a 2 digit answer, start by ignoring the 2 rightmost digits, and finding the closest square root to the left over

Ex. $\sqrt{2209}$, ignore the 09 and focus on the 22
The closest square to 22 is 25, so the 10s digit is close too but less than 5, meaning it has to be 4

To find the ones digit of your answer, look at the last digit of your number, it will be the same number that the ones digit of your answer ends with with squared, so in this case the only numbers it could be are 7 (49 ends in 9) or 3 (9 ends in 9), but since the number is much closer to $50^2$ than $40^2$ (2500 vs 1600) it has to be the 7, so you answer would be 47

### Chart for units digit
| Number ends in | Square root ends in      |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1              | 1 (**1**) or 9 (8**1**)  |
| 4              | 2 (**4**) or 8 (6**4**)  |
| 5              | 5 (2**5**)               |
| 6              | 4 (1**6**) or 6 (3**6**) |
