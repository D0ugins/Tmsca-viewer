When adding $x^2 + 3x^2$, first find $x^2$ (usually x is less than 20), then add a 0 to the end

### $17^2 + 51^2$

| Step                | Math         | Write down |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Square first number | $17^2 = 289$ | 289        |
| Add 0 to the end    |              | 0          |

### Answer = 2890

*Note Can also be $x^2 + 2x^2$, same idea just divide by 2 before adding the 0
