For a 2 digit number (XY) the answer is (X (X+Y) Y) so for example

$$54 \times 11 = 5 ~~ (5+4) ~~ 4 = 594$$
If the two numbers add to a number greater than or equal to 10, the middle digit is the units digit of the number, and you carry the one to the first digit

$$76 \times 11 = 7 ~~ (7+6) ~~ 4 = 7 ~~ (13) ~~ 4 = 834$$

For numbers larger than 2 digits, add pairs of adjacent numbers from right to left and each result is the next digit of the number

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Start with just left digit | $2 = 2$                        | Write down a 2            |
| Sum of last 2 digits       | $7 + 2 = 9$                    | Write down 9              |
| Sum of next 2              | $5 + 7 = 12$                   | Write down 2, carry the 1 |
| Sum of last 2              | $3 + 5 + \text{carried }1 = 9$ | Write down 9              |
| End with just right digit  | $3 = 3$                        | Write down a 3            |
